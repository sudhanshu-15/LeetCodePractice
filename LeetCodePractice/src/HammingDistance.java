/*Hamming Distance: The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.*/


/*Number Complement: Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.*/
